# enviroInteracts
## Simulational and experimental illustration of the environmentally-mediated interaction framework.

This repository contains all code and data necessary to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript 'Environment-organism feedbacks drive changes in1
ecological interactions', by Oliver J. Meacock and Sara Mitri.

It contains two directories, **Data** and **Models**, which respectively contain raw growthcurve data and R scripts for their analysis, and Jupyter notebooks containing code for simulating corresponding OE systems.
