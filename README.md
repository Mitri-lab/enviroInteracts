# enviroInteracts
## Simulational and experimental illustration of environmentally-mediated interactions.

This repository contains all code and data necessary to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript 'Environment-organism feedbacks drive changes in ecological interactions', by Oliver J. Meacock and Sara Mitri.

It contains two directories, **Data** and **Models**, which respectively contain raw measurements and R scripts for their analysis, and Jupyter notebooks containing code for simulating OE systems.

### Data

Contains the following sub-folders:
 - Intra-specific interactions: contains original .xpt files (generated by BioTek Gen5â„¢ software) of growthcurves (XXX_Ct_Proline_Ampicillin_PopulationDependence.xpt) and corresponding .xlsx files containing exported values. Analyse_09_23_Timecourses_Amp_Pro_Ct_Triplicate.R can be used to analyse and plot these datasets. 
 - MICs: contains raw OD measurements for calculating MICs of ampicillin (07_10_23_Ct_MICs.xpt), as well as a corresponding .xlsx file containing exported values. Analyse_09_23_Ct_MICs.R can be used to plot these datasets.
 - Beta-lactamase assays: contains raw spectrophotometer measurements of nitrocefin hydrolysis rate for each sampled timepoint (16_02_23_Ct_At_BetaLactamaseAssay_t=X.xpt), along with raw exports of the data to .xlsx format. 'ResultsWorkable.xlsx' contains this data converted to a human-readable format, and also includes CFU data for the same experiment. 'Plot_16_02_23_BetaLactamaseAssays.R' reads the data from this workbook and plots it.

### Models

Contains two Jupyter notebooks, Degrader-crossfeeder model.ipynb and Toxin-nutrient model.ipynb that can be used to reproduce the simulations and figures presented in the manuscript. More exact specifications of the code used to generate each figure is given in the notebooks.
