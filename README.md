# enviroInteracts
## Simulational and experimental illustration of environmentally-mediated interactions.

This repository contains all code and data necessary to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript 'Environment-organism feedbacks drive changes in ecological interactions', by Oliver J. Meacock and Sara Mitri.

It contains two directories, **Data** and **Models**, which respectively contain raw growthcurve data and R scripts for their analysis, and Jupyter notebooks containing code for simulating corresponding OE systems.

### Data

Contains original .xpt files (generated by BioTek Gen5â„¢ software) of growthcurves (XXX_Ct_Proline_Ampicillin_PopulationDependence.xpt) and MIC measurements (07_10_23_Ct_MICs.xpt), as well as corresponding .xlsx files containing exported values. The scripts Analyse_09_23_Timecourses_Amp_Pro_Ct_Triplicate.R and Analyse_09_23_Ct_MICs.R can be used to analyse and plot these datasets.

### Models

Contains two Jupyter notebooks, Degrader-crossfeeder model.ipynb and Toxin-nutrient model.ipynb that can be used to reproduce the simulations and figures presented in the manuscript. More exact specifications of the code used to generate each figure is given in the notebooks.
